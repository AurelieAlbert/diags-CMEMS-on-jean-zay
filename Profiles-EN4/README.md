# All the steps in producing plots of comparison of temp ans salt profiles between ARGO profiles and MEDWEST60 simulations


## Selection of the profiles for the region and date

  - map of locations of the profiles :

  - problem : get rid of the profiles in Atlantic or near Corsica (too close to the boundary), check if 1Â° circle in ocean or land in MEDWEST60 mask
  - also : very few profiles ~30 for the region and dates, compare with profiles from other years with same date ? (climatological ?) 
  
=> diag on eNATL60MED 1year of data first !
